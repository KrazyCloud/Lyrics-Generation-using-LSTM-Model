## Lyrics Generation using LSTM Model

This project focuses on utilizing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to generate song lyrics based on an input text. The model is trained on a dataset of song lyrics and can generate new lyrics in a similar style.

## Overview

The code in this repository is responsible for:

* Importing necessary libraries for data processing, visualization, and model building.
* Reading a dataset of song lyrics and preprocessing the text data.
* Creating a LSTM-based neural network model for text generation.
* Training the model and visualizing the training process.
* Generating song lyrics using the trained model.
* Creating a word cloud visualization of the entire lyrics dataset.

## Setup and Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* NLTK
* Keras
* TensorFlow
* Wordcloud
* PIL

## Usage
1. Data Preparation: The code reads a CSV file containing song lyrics. You can replace the dataset path in the code with your own dataset or modify the data loading process.
2. Model Building and Training: The LSTM model architecture is created and trained on the lyrics dataset. The model architecture and training details are provided in the code.
3. Generating Lyrics: The trained model can be used to generate new lyrics. You can modify the input text to generate lyrics with different starting phrases.
4. Word Cloud Visualization: The code generates a word cloud visualization representing the most frequent words in the lyrics dataset.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
> git clone https://github.com/your_username/lyrics-generation.git
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file:
> pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Execute the Python script lyrics_generation.py:
> python lyrics_generation.py

## Example Usage
Below is an example of generating lyrics using the provided code:
# Example of generating lyrics
> song_lyrics = Lyrics_Generator("main chala akele raston pe, tanha manzil hai kahan", 400)
> print(song_lyrics)
